# GSCUpdates
Repository for GSC remote updates

This is a repository for binary (.bin) updates for Geoff's Sonos Controller, an ESP32 based portable sonos controller.
When a controller is started it checks this repository for the latest version.  If a later version exists
it does an Over the Air (OTA) update.
